In this project, I created a multi-page dashboard to display maps, data visualizations, and other information regarding the 100 most populated Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the United States. 

# Maps
On the first Page of the Project, there are many interactive maps that are displayed, each visualizing a different statistic or characteristic, such as population, race, economic data, etc. This page is extremely useful as it allows users to see which areas are the most populated, have the highest immigrant populations, and how certain statistics are different across the country. Some maps, like "Education" and "Race" provide extra interactivity with radio buttons to give extra insights about certain areas.

# Demographics
This page provides more in-depth analytics about each MSA, including time series data on population and income, age distributions, details on the immigrant/foreign-born populations, and information on race and gender. The majority of MSAs have similar age distributions, with upward trends and some outliers. States like Texas and Florida have a very high Hispanic population, and many of the large MSAs, such as New York City, Chicago, and Boston, have large immigrant populations from all over the world. This page is great for discovering patterns, and looking in-depth at certain MSAs.
