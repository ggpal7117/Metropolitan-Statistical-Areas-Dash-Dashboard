In this project, I created a multi-page dashboard to display maps, data visualizations, and other information regarding the 100 most populated metropolitan areas in the United States. 

# Maps
On the first Page of the Project, there are many interactive maps that are displayed, each visualizing a different statistic or characteristic, such as population, race, economic data, etc. This page is extremely useful as it allows users to see which areas are the most populated, have the highest immigrant populations, and how certain statistics are different across the country. Some maps like "Education", and "Race" provide extra interactivity with radio buttons to give extra insights about certain areas.
