In this project, I created a multi-page dashboard to display maps, data visualizations, and other information regarding the 100 most populated Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the United States. 

# Maps
On the first Page of the Project, there are many interactive maps that are displayed, each visualizing a different statistic or characteristic, such as population, race, economic data, etc. This page is extremely useful as it allows users to see which areas are the most populated, have the highest immigrant populations, and how certain statistics are different across the country. Some maps, like "Education" and "Race" provide extra interactivity with radio buttons to give extra insights about certain areas.

# Demographics
This page provides more in-depth analytics about each MSA, including time series data on population and income, age distributions, details on the immigrant/foreign-born populations, and information on race and gender. The majority of MSAs have similar age distributions, with upward trends and some outliers. States like Texas and Florida have a very high Hispanic population, and many of the large MSAs, such as New York City, Chicago, and Boston, have large immigrant populations from all over the world. This page is great for discovering patterns and looking in-depth at certain MSAs.

# Economy
This page pulls live data from the Federal Reserve Economic Database to see Employment Trends. This required utilizing the operating system to cache the data, and then to update the data after a certain period. The top of the page will show two graphs, unemployment rates, and total non-farm workers in the MSA. All trends are nuanced; however, there is generally a large spike in unemployment and a large dip in nonfarm workers in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The page also shows family income distributions that can be filtered by race, aswell as historical poverty rates. Generally, poverty has reduced substantially in all metropolitan areas from my analysis, which shows the American Economy has been doing well. The last section shows a pie chart of where/what industries people work in. It is very clear from this chart, that the majority of people in metropolitan areas work for private companies, education, and health services.
